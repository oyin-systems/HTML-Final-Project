        Welcome to my world! I'm a Software Developer with a passion for
        Frontend Development. By day, you'll find me coding, and did you know
        that I once hated coding? By night, I transform into a Fashion
        Enthusiast.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly believe in the power of love and optimism. When I'm not
        working, you can catch me listening to music, or watching movies or
        playing board games, which include Scrabble and Chess. I love good food,
        and here's a fun fact-I enjoy trying out new things in the kitchen.
      </p>

      <p>
        My motto is "Be the Energy You Want to Attract", and I'm always up for
        hangouts and movie dates. Let's connect and share our stories!
