        <p>
          Mount Kilimanjaro (/ˌkɪlɪmənˈdʒɑːroʊ/) is a dormant volcano located in
          Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo,
          Mawenzi, and Shira. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the
          highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world:
          5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 m (16,100 ft)
          above its plateau base. It is the highest volcano in Africa and the
          Eastern Hemisphere.

            Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically
          prominent peak on Earth. It is part of Kilimanjaro National Park and
          is a major hiking and climbing destination. Because of its shrinking
          glaciers and ice fields, which are projected to disappear between 2025
          and 2035, it has been the subject of many scientific studies. Picture

            The origin of the name Kilimanjaro is not known, but a number of theories exist. European
          explorers had adopted the name by 1860 and reported that Kilimanjaro
          was the mountain's Kiswahili name. The 1907 edition of The Nuttall
          Encyclopædia also records the name of the mountain as Kilima-Njaro.
