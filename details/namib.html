        <p>
          The Namib (/ˈnɑːmɪb/ NAH-mib;[1] Portuguese: Namibe) is a coastal
          desert in Southern Africa. According to the broadest definition, the
          Namib stretches for more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) along the
          Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia, and northwest South Africa,
          extending southward from the Carunjamba River in Angola, through
          Namibia and to the Olifants River in Western Cape, South
          Africa.[2][3][4] The Namib's northernmost portion, which extends 450
          kilometres (280 mi) from the Angola-Namibia border, is known as
          Moçâmedes Desert, while its southern portion approaches the
          neighboring Kalahari Desert.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Namib is almost completely uninhabited by humans except for
          several small settlements and indigenous pastoral groups, including
          the Ovahimba and Obatjimba Herero in the north, and the Topnaar Nama
          in the central region.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the outer Namib is largely barren of vegetation, lichens and
          succulents are found in coastal areas, while grasses, shrubs, and
          ephemeral plants thrive near the escarpment. Several types of trees
          are also able to survive the extremely arid climate.
