        <p>
          Antarctica (/ænˈtɑːrktɪkə/ ⓘ) is Earth's southernmost and
          least-populated continent. Situated almost entirely south of the
          Antarctic Circle and surrounded by the Southern Ocean (also known as
          the Antarctic Ocean), it contains the geographic South Pole.
          Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, being about 40% larger than
          Europe, and has an area of 14,200,000 km2 (5,500,000 sq mi). Most of
          Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, with an average
          thickness of 1.9 km (1.2 mi).
        </p>

        <p>
          Antarctica is, on average, the coldest, driest, and windiest of the
          continents, and it has the highest average elevation. It is mainly a
          polar desert, with annual precipitation of over 200 mm (8 in) along
          the coast and far less inland. About 70% of the world's freshwater
          reserves are frozen in Antarctica, which, if melted, would raise
          global sea levels by almost 60 metres (200 ft).
        </p>

        <p>
          Antarctica is governed by about 30 countries, all of which are parties
          of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty System. According to the terms of the
          treaty, military activity, mining, nuclear explosions, and nuclear
          waste disposal are all prohibited in Antarctica. Tourism, fishing and
          research are the main human activities in and around Antarctica.
          During the summer months, about 5,000 people reside at research
          stations, a figure that drops to around 1,000 in the winter. Despite
          its remoteness, human activity has a significant impact on the
          continent via pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change.
